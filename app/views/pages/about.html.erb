		<h1>Hey, I'm Jonathon Schloss</h1>
		<p>A Hyper Active Caffeinated Euphoric Millennial!</p>
		<p>I’m a Developer in Fort Lauderdale.  I’m currently pursuing a longtime passion of mine: to become a Full Stack Developer. I love to create but, more importantly, I love to learn. On the opposite side of the spectrum, I put my focus towards soft skills, such as Agile Development and Software Presentations. My interests go beyond the realm of just coding; I love the design aspect, as well as the interaction between the product and user.</p>
		<p>If you'd like to follow along as I learn more Ruby on Rails, find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/jschloss309">@Jschloss309</a> or on the web at <a href="http://jschloss.github.io">MySite</a>, and get my posts and exclusive content in your inbox by signing up for my newsletter <a href="www.google.com">here</a>.</p>
